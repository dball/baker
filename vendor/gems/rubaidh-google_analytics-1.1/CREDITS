This plugin was initially release by Graeme Mathieson, of Rubaidh Ltd.
However, since it appeared on github, it has benefited from the contributions
of many, including:

* Mike Gunderloy (ffmike)
* Mark Catley (markcatley)
* Kenneth Kalmer (kennethkalmer)
* Daniel Morrison (danielmorrison)

Thank you to all these folks for their contributions, and thank you also to
Github for facilitating their contribution without having to wait for me to
accept patches!

If I've missed anybody out, please fork, patch and send me a pull request. :-)
